      "Preservatives are substances added to products to prevent microbial growth and deterioration caused by oxidation or by fungi. They are crucial for extending the shelf life of various items, from food and beverages to pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and industrial materials. Be it of natural, processed or synthetic origin; preservatives play a vital role in modern society by ensuring food safety, increasing the availability of goods for longer duration and maintaining product consistency.",
    additionalInfo: "They help to maintain safety and effectiveness of products over time by preventing undesirable chemical changes. They create an environment inhospitable to microbial growth while maintaining the product's desired characteristics. This protective action ensures that products remain safe and effective from the point of manufacture until they reach the end user even after multiple uses or extended storage periods. It is essential to note that use of preservatives are subject to product composition, indented use, storage conditions & strict regulated guidelines ensuring consumer safety and minimising any potential health hazards.",
