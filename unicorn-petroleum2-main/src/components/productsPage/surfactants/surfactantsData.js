    description:
      "Surfactants find its importance in a varied range of cleaning & personal care products by reducing surface tension and enabling blending of water with dirt & other contaminants. Jointly, surfactants play a vital role in diverse formulations from helping shampoos foam up to removing grease from products. Due to its adaptable nature, it is a crucial ingredient that finds its importance in the homecare and personal care industry.",
    additionalInfo: "As surfactants are used in combination, they place themselves at the junction between two substances in a way that the hydrophilic part interconnects with the water molecules while the hydrophobic part attaches with the other substance. This leads to an obstruction between the two compounds thereby decreasing surface tension and lighting the dirt from surface tension for effective results. In line with these functionalities, we offer surfactants such as Alpha olefin sulphonate (AOS), Sodium lauryl ether sulphate (SLES), Cocamido propyl betaine (CAPB), and Linear alkyl benzene sulphonic acid (LABSA).",

      "Personal care: Enhance foaming, cleaning, and moisturising in shampoos, conditioners, body washes, soaps, and toothpaste.",
      "Cleaning agents: They improve the cleaning power and foam stability in soaps, detergents, and dishwashing liquids by removing dirt / grease.",
      "Textile industry: They also serve their importance in textile industry by improving properties like softness of the fabric, making the fabric antistatic and anti-bacterial, sweat absorbent and allowing the fabric to dry quickly in textile finishing process.",
      "Automotive industry: Due to their ability to reduce surface tension, surfactants are widely used in car cleaning agents and in engine degreases to remove dirt / grease & oil deposits.",
      "Paints & Coatings: These agents improve dispersion in automotive paints, enhance coating adhesion and uniformity, and prevent defects like streaks and bubbles during printing. They function as emulsifiers, wetting agents, and dispersants."
