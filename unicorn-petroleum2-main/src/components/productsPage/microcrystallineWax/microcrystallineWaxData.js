      "Known for its crystal finesse, microcrystalline waxes are produced by de-oiling petrolatum, as part of the petroleum refining process. With an affinity for paraffin wax and mineral oil, it is widely used in oil-based formulations in the cosmetic / pharmaceutical industry, adding structural strength and lustre to the final product. Whether it's locking in moisture or improving texture and stability, our waxes are formulated to perform.",
    // additionalInfo:
    //   "At Unicorn, we manufacture microcrystalline wax with uncompromising attention to quality. Our process ensures precise control over melting point, hardness, and viscosity — delivering waxes that are consistent, pure, and ready for global compliance. Each batch is rigorously tested to meet industry-specific standards so you can formulate with confidence.",
