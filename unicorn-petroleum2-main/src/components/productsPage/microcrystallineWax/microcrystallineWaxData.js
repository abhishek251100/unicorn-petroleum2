      "Known for its crystal finesse, microcrystalline waxes are produced by de-oiling petrolatum, as part of the petroleum refining process. With an affinity for paraffin wax and mineral oil, it is widely used in oil-based formulations in the cosmetic / pharmaceutical industry, adding structural strength and lustre to the final product. Whether it's locking in moisture or improving texture and stability, our waxes are formulated to perform.",
