    description:
      "Microcrystalline waxes are a type of wax produced by de-oiling petrolatum, as part of the petroleum refining process. It is characterised by the fineness of its crystals and is a higher molecular weight saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon. The elastic and adhesive characteristics of microcrystalline waxes are due to their branched-chain components. This wax has affinity for paraffin wax and mineral oil, due to which it is widely used in oil-based formulations in the cosmetic/pharmaceutical industry. It provides strong oil-holding performance, minimizing oil separation, thus helping formulations to remain stable and consistent throughout long-term storage. Microwax works as a reliable occlusive agent, creating a protective layer on the skin that helps lock in moisture and prevent dehydration in topical formulations. Micro waxes add structural strength and lustre to the final product.",
    // additionalInfo:
    //   "At Unicorn, we manufacture microcrystalline wax with uncompromising attention to quality. Our process ensures precise control over melting point, hardness, and viscosity — delivering waxes that are consistent, pure, and ready for global compliance. Each batch is rigorously tested to meet industry-specific standards so you can formulate with confidence.",
