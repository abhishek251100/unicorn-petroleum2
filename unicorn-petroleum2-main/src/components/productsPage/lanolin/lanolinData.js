      "Lanolin which is frequently referred to as Wool Fat / Adeps Lanae is a highly refined and purified natural grease that originates as a unique substance secreted by sheep from the sebaceous glands in their skin to form a natural protective coating on the wool fibers and is completely different from the body fat of animals. The crude grease is recovered from the natural, greasy wool of sheep and finished Lanolin is derived from the said natural grease after intensive refining and a series of other unique processes.",

      "Improves the stability of oil in water emulsions.",
      "Its emollience restores and retains the moisture balance of the skin while not interfering with its normal transpiration, thereby preventing the drying and the chapping of the skin. It thus makes the skin feel smooth, soft and supple.",
      "It possesses anti-corrosive, protective and lubricating properties which are used for industrial applications. Lanolin is non-conductive thereby finding extensive use in making electric components.",
