      "Absorption of UV Radiation: UV filters act as a shield by blocking UV radiation from entering into the skin either by reflecting, absorbing or scattering the UV radiation. They provide a shield against UVA and UVB radiation which contributes to premature skin ageing and sunburns.",
      "Wide-Range protection: Our Avobenzone and Octocrylene have the ability to provide complete protection by blocking UVA & UVB radiation respectively.",
      "Photostability: This is the property that determines the stability of UV Filters when exposed to direct sunlight. Example: Avobenzone can deteriorate under direct sunrays unless it is stabilised by other ingredients such as Octocrylene.",
      "Safety and Compatibility: UV Filters should not cause any adverse effects for continuous skin exposure. There should not be any irritation or allergic reaction and they should have the tendency not to block the pores. Example: Benzophenone is considered to be safe for all skin types. Various UV Filters can be used in diverse formulations to impart all-around stability and skin-friendly performance."
