    description:
      'Our materials are used in lubricant formulations as functional components and base stocks. They help to provide consistent performance, controlled viscosity, and thermal stability. These materials provide for smooth mechanical action, wear prevention, and friction reduction in hydraulic systems, gear oils, and industrial equipment applications. They may be utilized in a wide range of automotive, marine, and heavy-duty industrial lubricant compositions. Their durability guarantees consistent performance across a wide variety of operational circumstances enabling lubricant manufacturers to provide long-lasting, efficient and diverse lubrication solutions.',
