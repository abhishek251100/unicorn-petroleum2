They enhance the texture, shine, and spreadability of cosmetics and skincare products. These ingredients promote formulation stability and uniformity across a variety of product formats, including creams, lotions, balms, and color cosmetics. They help facilitate smooth application while improving the sensory experience in facial, body, and lip care products. Their versatility also supports use in decorative cosmetics and skin conditioning applications. This adaptability makes them suitable for a wide range of cosmetic innovations and developments."
